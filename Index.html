  <h4>Sky Zone is a chain of indoor trampoline parks in the United States, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Guam, Guatemala, India, Kuwait, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and UAE that features numerous connected trampolines. Some locations now provide rock climbing walls and miniature American Ninja Warrior courses as well as a small, medium or high warped wall. Visitors of all ages that take a visit to Sky Zone can bounce from one trampoline to another, jump into pits filled with foam blocks and play a trampoline-based version of dodgeball. Since its launch in 2004 in the Las Vegas Valley, Sky Zone has expanded to 17 states and 3 provinces, with plans for locations in additional states and provinces. In 2013, Sky Zone announced a master franchise license with Strike Bowling Bar to build 10 parks in Australia as well as future parks in New Zealand. There are plans to open in Bahrain, Guatemala, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</h4>
